Interactive Coding Quiz

During this project I created an interactive coding quiz that features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

The objective of the game is to get through the series of questions in the fastest time possible. The final time remaining is the final game score. 
For every question answered wrong, 15 seconds is docked off the total time. When the game is over, the user has the option of typing in their initials
and saving their high score to view for later.
